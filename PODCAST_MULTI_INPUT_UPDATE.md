# 📚 Podcast Feature - Multiple Input Support Update

## What Changed

The podcast generation feature now supports **three input methods** instead of just arXiv URLs!

---

## New Input Options

### 1. ✅ arXiv URL (Original)
- Direct link to arXiv papers
- Fast and automatic

### 2. 🆕 PDF File Upload
- Upload any research paper PDF
- Works with published papers not on arXiv
- File size limit: Based on your backend configuration

### 3. 🆕 LaTeX Source (ZIP)
- Upload LaTeX source code
- Best text extraction quality
- Must be a `.zip` file containing `.tex` files

---

## UI Changes

### Tabbed Interface
The podcast page now has three tabs:
- **arXiv URL** (link icon)
- **PDF File** (document icon)
- **LaTeX ZIP** (upload icon)

### Smart File Upload
- Drag & drop or click to upload
- File type validation
- Real-time file name display

---

## How to Use

### For arXiv Papers:
1. Go to `/podcast` page
2. Select "arXiv URL" tab (default)
3. Enter URL: `https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX`
4. Click "Generate Podcast"

### For PDF Files:
1. Go to `/podcast` page
2. Select "PDF File" tab
3. Click "Click to upload PDF"
4. Choose your PDF file
5. Click "Generate Podcast from PDF"

### For LaTeX Source:
1. Go to `/podcast` page
2. Select "LaTeX ZIP" tab
3. Click "Click to upload ZIP file"
4. Choose your `.zip` file containing LaTeX source
5. Click "Generate Podcast from LaTeX"

## Backend Integration

The feature uses existing upload endpoints:
- `POST /api/papers/scrape-arxiv` (arXiv)
- `POST /api/papers/upload-pdf` (PDF)
- `POST /api/papers/upload-zip` (LaTeX)

After upload, the same podcast generation pipeline runs:
1. Generate scripts
2. Create student-teacher dialogue
3. Generate audio with Bhashini TTS

---

## Updated Files

**Frontend:**
- `src/pages/PodcastGeneration.jsx` - Added multi-input UI

**Documentation:**
- `PODCAST_FEATURE_SETUP.md` - Updated with all input methods

**No Backend Changes Required!** 
The podcast feature reuses existing paper upload endpoints.

---

## Benefits

✅ **More Flexible**: Works with papers from any source  
✅ **Better Quality**: LaTeX source provides best text extraction  
✅ **User-Friendly**: Intuitive tab interface  
✅ **Consistent**: Same podcast generation for all inputs

## Example Workflow

```
User clicks "Generate Podcast" on homepage
  ↓
Podcast page opens with 3 tabs
  ↓
User selects input method:
  → arXiv URL: Types URL
  → PDF: Uploads file
  → LaTeX: Uploads ZIP
  ↓
System processes paper (30-60s)
  ↓
Generates dialogue script (1 min)
  ↓
Creates audio with Bhashini (2-3 min)
  ↓
User plays/downloads podcast!
```

## Testing

Try all three methods:

**Test 1 - arXiv:**
```
URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345
Expected: Quick fetch and process
```

**Test 2 - PDF:**
```
File: Any research paper PDF < 10MB
Expected: Upload and text extraction
```

**Test 3 - LaTeX:**
```
File: LaTeX source code as .zip
Expected: Best quality text extraction
```

---

## Notes

- All three methods generate identical podcast format
- PDF and LaTeX may take slightly longer for processing
- File size limits apply to uploads (configure in backend)
- Progress indicators show current step for all methods

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- 📄 Direct text input for abstracts
- 🌐 DOI-based paper fetching
- 📚 Batch processing multiple papers
- 🎨 Custom voice selection per speaker

---

## Summary

The podcast feature is now **more versatile** and **user-friendly**, accepting papers from any source while maintaining the same high-quality AI-generated educational conversations!

🎙️ Happy podcasting!
